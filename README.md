# Mellifluous Myna

Mellifluous Myna is a machine learning project with an initial aim of creating a model that classifies any music to a suitable genre based on its features. This project makes use of audio feature data from Spotify for training and testing the model.

## TODO

### Part 1

- [ ] Generate audio feature dataset (Script is ready)
- [ ] Explore suitable classification algorithms (Nearest neighbor, DBSCAN, Random Forest, Neural Networks, etc.)
- [ ] Create model for each algorithm
- [ ] Test different algorithms and create statistical comparisons between each models

### Part 2

- [ ] Explore algorithms to calculate features for a given music
- [ ] Create program to calculate audio features
- [ ] Test program for music excerpts and test calculated features with genre classifier
- [ ] Create documentation
